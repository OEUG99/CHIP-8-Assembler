# CHIP-8 Assembler
This is a simple assembler for the CHIP-8 virtual machine. It takes a text file with assembly instructions and outputs 
a binary file that can be loaded into a CHIP-8 emulator. It is a two-pass assembler, meaning that it first reads the
entire file and builds a symbol table, then it reads the file again and generates the binary file.
